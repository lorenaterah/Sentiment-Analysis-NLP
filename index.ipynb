   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Organizations increasingly rely on large volumes of unstructured text data to understand customer opinions, experiences and engagement. However, this data is difficult to analyze at scale because it is noisy, inconsistent and highly variable in language, structure and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided dataset, text entries must be classified into four emotion categories: **positive, negative, none and unknown**. The dataset also exhibits a strong class imbalance, with the *none* category representing a significantly larger proportion of the data compared to the other classes. This imbalance makes it difficult to build models that perform reliably across all categories, especially for minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, raw text contains noise such as irrelevant tokens and informal language, which can negatively affect model performance if not properly cleaned and transformed into meaningful numerical representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge addressed in this project is to design and evaluate an end-to-end NLP pipeline that can reliably transform raw text into structured features and accurately perform multi-class emotion classification, while mitigating the effects of class imbalance and minimizing information leakage during model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project therefore seeks to establish a robust and reproducible workflow for text preprocessing, feature extraction and supervised learning that can generalize well to unseen data and support real-world business use cases.\n"

    "To develop an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for automated multi-class text classification that accurately categorizes text data into positive, negative, none and unknown emotion classes, and evaluates the performance of different machine learning models on an imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "* To explore and understand the structure and distribution of the text dataset and emotion labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To clean and preprocess raw text data by removing noise and irrelevant tokens in order to improve data quality for modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To transform textual data into numerical feature representations using TF-IDF vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To build machine learning pipelines that integrate text vectorization and classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To train and evaluate multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and Linear Support Vector Machines, for multi-class text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score, with particular focus on macro-averaged metrics due to class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Objectives\n",
    "* To investigate how different linear machine learning classifiers perform on an imbalanced multi-class text classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To examine the effect of TF-IDF feature engineering, including the use of n-grams, on the predictive performance of text classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To determine which classification model provides the most balanced and reliable performance across all emotion categories."

    "* The trained models are able to correctly perform multi-class emotion classification for the four target classes: positive, negative, none and unknown.\n",

    "* At least one trained model demonstrates improved and more balanced performance across minority classes (positive, negative and unknown) when compared to a naive majority-class baseline.\n",
