   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Organizations increasingly rely on large volumes of unstructured text data to understand customer opinions, experiences and engagement. However, this data is difficult to analyze at scale because it is noisy, inconsistent and highly variable in language, structure and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided dataset, text entries must be classified into four emotion categories: **positive, negative, none and unknown**. The dataset also exhibits a strong class imbalance, with the *none* category representing a significantly larger proportion of the data compared to the other classes. This imbalance makes it difficult to build models that perform reliably across all categories, especially for minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, raw text contains noise such as irrelevant tokens and informal language, which can negatively affect model performance if not properly cleaned and transformed into meaningful numerical representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge addressed in this project is to design and evaluate an end-to-end NLP pipeline that can reliably transform raw text into structured features and accurately perform multi-class emotion classification, while mitigating the effects of class imbalance and minimizing information leakage during model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project therefore seeks to establish a robust and reproducible workflow for text preprocessing, feature extraction and supervised learning that can generalize well to unseen data and support real-world business use cases.\n"

    "To develop an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for automated multi-class text classification that accurately categorizes text data into positive, negative, none and unknown emotion classes, and evaluates the performance of different machine learning models on an imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "* To explore and understand the structure and distribution of the text dataset and emotion labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To clean and preprocess raw text data by removing noise and irrelevant tokens in order to improve data quality for modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To transform textual data into numerical feature representations using TF-IDF vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To build machine learning pipelines that integrate text vectorization and classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To train and evaluate multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and Linear Support Vector Machines, for multi-class text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score, with particular focus on macro-averaged metrics due to class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Objectives\n",
    "* To investigate how different linear machine learning classifiers perform on an imbalanced multi-class text classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To examine the effect of TF-IDF feature engineering, including the use of n-grams, on the predictive performance of text classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To determine which classification model provides the most balanced and reliable performance across all emotion categories."

    "* The trained models are able to correctly perform multi-class emotion classification for the four target classes: positive, negative, none and unknown.\n",

    "* At least one trained model demonstrates improved and more balanced performance across minority classes (positive, negative and unknown) when compared to a naive majority-class baseline.\n",

    "### Key Insights \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Distribution:**  \n",
    "   - The dataset is moderately imbalanced, with the majority of tweets falling under the neutral or positive sentiment categories. This suggests that most users express neutral or favorable opinions rather than negative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Performance:**  \n",
    "   - Among the models tested, **Linear SVC** performed the best, achieving the highest accuracy and macro F1 score, indicating it can effectively distinguish between positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.  \n",
    "   - Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes also performed reasonably well, providing reliable baseline and alternative options.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Importance:**  \n",
    "   - Words and bigrams extracted via TF-IDF were effective in capturing sentiment cues. Certain adjectives and sentiment-laden phrases had the strongest influence on predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Cleaning Impact:**  \n",
    "   - Preprocessing steps like lowercasing, removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, numbers, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization significantly improved model accuracy and reduced noise in the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment analysis project successfully demonstrated the process of cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling textual data from tweets to classify them into positive, negative, and neutral emotions. Through rigorous preprocessing steps—including lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization—the text was transformed into a consistent format suitable for machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the models tested, **Linear SVC** achieved the best overall performance, making it the most effective choice for sentiment classification in this dataset. The results highlight the importance of both careful feature extraction using TF-IDF and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project shows that text preprocessing, appropriate model selection, and tuning are critical for achieving accurate sentiment predictions. The insights gained from this analysis can inform strategies for monitoring public opinion, understanding user behavior, and supporting data-driven decision-making in applications that rely on sentiment information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "1. **Handle Class Imbalance:**  \n",
    "   - Consider techniques like oversampling minority classes, undersampling majority classes, or using class-weighted models to further improve performance on underrepresented sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Advanced Embeddings:**  \n",
    "   - Explore contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for capturing semantic nuances in text, which may improve sentiment classification, especially for subtle or sarcastic tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Continuous Model Evaluation:**  \n",
    "   - Regularly update the model with new data to maintain accuracy over time, particularly as trends and language usage in tweets evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Analysis:**  \n",
    "   - Review misclassified examples to identify common failure cases, such as sarcasm, slang, or ambiguous expressions, and consider augmenting the dataset or fine-tuning preprocessing rules accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deployment Considerations:**  \n",
    "   - For real-time sentiment monitoring, package the best-performing model into an API and integrate it with dashboards or reporting tools for actionable insights.\n"
